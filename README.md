There will be two players

They will work together to defeat waves of monsters

They must navigate through the map (see wireframe) without getting touched by a monster

They can shoot the monsters to defeat them

Monsters will have an increasing amount of hit points each round

The users must defeat all monsters to win a wave

If there's time I will implement weapons that do different amounts of damage and interact in different ways with the monsters (maybe area of effect or mines that can be placed).

Players will be able to see what wave they are on and how many monsters remain
